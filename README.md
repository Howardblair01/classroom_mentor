# Classroom Mentor




- When you post a question or comment, you can expect a reply within 24 hours (i.e. communication isn't *Live*).

- So any technical questions that you have will have to be posed in a way that I can answer them directly (i.e. if I need clarification on any parts of your question then they will be difficult to answer, and will lead to a frustrating time lag for you).

- Classroom mentors do not review projects before submission (We can clarify questions that you have about the requirements or review comments but we can't pre-review projects). Once you are happy that you have met the requirements (laid out in the project Rubric), then you are ready to submit your project.

## Posting Code in the Chat Window:

- On **separate** lines, **before** and **after** your code, you put three **backticks**  (which are beside 1 on a QWERTY keyboard  <kbd>  ` </kbd> <kbd>  1 </kbd> </kbd> <kbd>  2 </kbd>  ) - which look like:<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

    ![alt text][image_0]
    
- To move to a new line, in the chat window, use `Shift + Enter` at the same time.

- **Note**: Any spaces on the lines with _`'backticks'`_ will produce very odd formatting.

- For example:

    ![alt text][image_1]

- That is, the individual steps are:

  1. Type three backticks.

  2. Press Shift + Enter at the same time (to move to a new line).

  3. Copy and paste your code directly into the window.

  4. Press Shift + Enter at the same time (to move to a new line).

  5. Type three backticks.
